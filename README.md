# CognoRise-Infotech

**Intern Name:** Bhagi Rath Manda  
**Position:** Java Development Intern  
**Internship Duration:** 4 Weeks  
**Company:** CognoRise Infotech  

## Overview
This repository contains the code for three Java projects developed during my internship at CognoRise Infotech. Each project was designed to build practical applications, demonstrating my skills in Java and Android development.

## Projects

### Task 1: Number Guessing Game
This is an interactive game where users attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback, guiding users towards the correct answer. This project strengthened my understanding of control structures and user input handling in Java.

### Task 2: Calculator App
A simple yet effective calculator app that supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project taught me the essentials of Android UI design, event handling, and managing user interactions.

### Task 3: Library Management System
A more complex application designed to simulate a library management system, allowing for the management of book inventory, user data, and loan records. This project reinforced my knowledge of object-oriented programming, data management, and database interaction in Java.

## Internship Goals and Learning Outcomes
Throughout this internship, I aimed to:
- Enhance my skills in Java development.
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world application building.
- Develop problem-solving abilities and improve user interface design skills.
